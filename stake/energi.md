# Quick Guide
On your VPS run this to get VPS staking setup  

    bash -ic "$(wget -4qO- -o- raw.githubusercontent.com/mikeytown2/masternode/master/stake/energid.sh)" ; source ~/.bashrc

`O` and `o` are both the letter and not the number if you are typing this out.  
[Bitvise](https://dl.bitvise.com/BvSshClient-Inst.exe) is highly recommended in order to use copy/paste (for windows).  
You can view the script here https://github.com/mikeytown2/masternode/blob/master/stake/energid.sh.  
At the prompts reply with `y` (recommended).

# VPS Staking Guide

What you need:  
- A Ubuntu 16.04 OR 18.04 Virtual Private Server ([VPS](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7876413-4F)) for running the staking node 
- Be sure to setup 2 factor auth for vultr; see https://my.vultr.com/settings/twofactor/ 
- A way to use SSH ([Bitvise](https://dl.bitvise.com/BvSshClient-Inst.exe) for windows or Terminal for Mac)  
- [Energi Wallet](https://github.com/energicryptocurrency/energi/releases/latest) ([Windows](https://github.com/energicryptocurrency/energi/releases/download/v2.2.1/energicore-2.2.1-win64-setup.exe),
 [Mac](https://github.com/energicryptocurrency/energi/releases/download/v2.2.1/energicore-2.2.1-macos.dmg), 
 [Linux](https://github.com/energicryptocurrency/energi/releases/download/v2.2.1/energicore-2.2.1-linux.tar.gz))
- [recommended at least 100 NRG Coins](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/energi/#markets)
- Help can be found on the [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/QACDTxt). 
  BE CAREFUL; only trust help via the ticket support system.
  Usernames are not unique on discord so only trust green, yellow, blue, and red users (people with roles) IN the Energi Discord server.

# Troubleshooting / FAQ  

<details><summary id="backup"><strong> How do I backup my wallet? </strong></summary>

Make sure it's been encrypted with a password and then store the wallet.dat file on 
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/). 
Make sure the cloud backup provider has 2 factor authentication enabled 
([Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en), 
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/enable-two-step-verification)). 
On windows the wallet can be found in the `%appdata%/energicore` directory 
(windows key + r `%appdata%/energicore` and if that doesn't work try `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\energicore`). 
On Mac it can be found in the `~/Library/Application Support/EnergiCore` directory; 
Finder -> Menubar (top of screen) -> Go -> Utilities, open Terminal, type in `open ~/Library/Application\ Support/EnergiCore`.

You can also backup via `dumpwallet`.  
Go to tools -> debug console and type in `dumpwallet enrg.txt`.  
enrg.txt is usually put in the same folder as the energi wallet executable.  
Print this out and keep it in a safe place.
